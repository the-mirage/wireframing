# Wireframing
A wireframe is the basic structure and layout of the system, without the detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Instead, it focuses on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.
A wireframe serves as the blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. Examples of wireframing tools include figma, miro, and draw.io.

## Types of wireframes
- Low-fidelity wireframes – Are simple sketches or basic digital layouts that focus on the overall structure and functionality over detailed design.
- High-fidelity wireframes – Entails more detailed and refined versions. Hi-Fi wireframes are often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
- Clarifies ideas and concepts – helps translate abstract ideas into tangible representations. Allows designers and stakeholders to visualize the layout and structure of a project early in the process.
- Facilitates communication – Serves as a communication tool among team members, clients, and stakeholders. This ensures everyone is on the same page regarding the design and functionality.
- Identifies usability issues – Helps identify possible usability issues early on, such as navigation problems, information hierarchy issues, and interaction flaws.
- Saves time and resources – Detecting design flaws and usability issues saves time and resources that would be spent on later revisions.
- Provides a clear layout and structure – A clear and simple representation of the layout allows designers to plan the content placement and prioritize elements effectively.
- Facilitates easy modifications – Making changes to a wireframe is quicker and cheaper than modifying a hi-fi design or developed product. This flexibility encourages experimentation and iterative improvement.
- Informs the design process – They serve as a guide for subsequent design and development phases, ensuring that the final product aligns with the initial vision and requirements.
- Focuses on functionality and user experience – By eliminating detailed design elements, designers can concentrate more on the functionality and UX. This ensures the final product turns out intuitive and user-friendly.

## What Are the Key Elements in Wireframing?
- Layout structure – Defines how elements are arranged on a page.
- Navigation – Shows how users will move through the application.
- Content placement – Outlines the positioning of text, images, and other content.
- Functionality – Outlines key functionalities and interactions.
